/// pick it up cleanly — in-memory state (cached provider data, the logged-in
/// user, theme/locale loaded once at startup) isn't refreshed by swapping
/// the file alone. Restart is mandatory here, not optional: continuing in
/// the same process would keep showing a mix of the old and new company's
/// data (e.g. the previous company's user still "logged in" against the
/// newly-active database), so there is no "close later" escape hatch — only
/// "Close App Now" (`exit(0)`), and the dialog can't be dismissed any other
/// way (barrier tap, back button, or Esc).
