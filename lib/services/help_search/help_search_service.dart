  ///    length mismatches between the query and the text it's compared

  ///    drags every score down regardless of match quality. The item's
  ///    best-scoring candidate wins.

  ///    Android's Contacts search uses: split the query into words and
  ///    check whether every one appears (as a substring) somewhere in the
  ///    item's question/keywords, in any order.
  ///
  /// For multi-word queries, (2) is the *primary* sort key, not just a
  /// fallback for items the fuzzy pass missed: an item containing every
  /// searched word must outrank one that only fuzzily resembles part of
  /// the query, even when the raw fuzzy ratio number says otherwise (e.g.
  /// "multi user" vs "How do I make a **user** an admin?" can out-score
  /// "How do I delete **multi**ple **user**s at once?" on pure ratio, even
  /// though only the second one actually contains both words). Fuzzy score
